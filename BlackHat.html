        <h3 class="divide center">Our Review</h3>

        <p class="center-text">&emsp;&emsp;Blackhat(2015) is surprisingly accurate in the way the movie portrays hacking. The movie contains four major hacking plot points that we can analyze for accuracy. Before we dive into the technical aspects of the movie I will give my two cents on the movie as a whole. Generally, the movie tends to run slow and the ending is lacklustre. As well as, the motives of the bad guys are confusing, to say the least. However, the attention to detail in the technical aspects makes me believe that Blackhat is the most accurate hacking movie I have ever seen.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;The first hacking scene in the movie is an attack on a nuclear power plant in Hong Kong.  The Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) in the water coolant pumps had their code modified via Remote Access Trojan (RAT). The RAT opened the door for a worm to infiltrate the PLCs. The malicious code stopped the pumps from cooling the reactor causing an explosion. In the movie, the RAT gained access from a USB that an employee always left on his desk. This attack in the movie is based on a real-world case where the Stuxnet worm destroyed numerous centrifuges in Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities. Stuxnet targeted the PLCs for the centrifuges and was spread via a USB. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;The second hacking scene was an infiltraftion into the Chicago Stock Exchange the malware artificially increased the price of soy stock. The malware was deployed when the IT administrator inserted his USB into the servers. They do not go into depth how the system was compromised however they do briefing show that the malicious code was an autorun file. This is a plausible attack method for how malware could infected the secure servers. Autorun malware is the most common attacks from USB. This style of attack targets the human interactions rather than the computer.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Now, how could this attack have been prevented? Only one employee is allowed access to the computer controlling the Chicago Stock Exchange. For him to gain access it requires multi-factor authentication and each entry is logged. The weakest link, in this case, was the USB used to install updates on the computer it was kept on an open desk where all employees had access. The USB needed to be as well guarded as the computer to prevent tampering. This is an example using social engineering to exploit the IT administrator's habits.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;The third hacking scene our protagonists send a phishing email to the NSA encouraging the recipient to download a PDF for instruction on how to reset his password. Inturn the employee actually instals keylogging malware to steal his updated password to the top secret remote program. The use of phishing emails and pdf to install malware are common practice and are incredibly effective. However, it is unlikely that a phishing attack would be successful against a NSA employe responsible for safeguard top secret digital projects. Additionally our protagonist would have needed to gain access NSA’s internal network to send internal emails. Otherwise the email would have been caught by NSA security filters.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;The fourth hacking scene our protagonists use social engineering to get a security guard to insert a USB into his computer and download a presentation. This then granted them access to the financial institutions internal network allowing them to transfer out and drain a bank account. This scene was by far the least accurate of them all. Although social engineering is a common tactic used to perform malicious attacks this case appears far fetched. It would be highly unlikely that the front desk security computer would be connected to the internal financial network. They are often isolated as to prevent these kinds of attacks. Bank accounts require lots of security measures to prevent theft hence they need to be isolated from computer networks that can be hacked by simple methods like social engineering.  
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Finally, we will discuss some of the minor mistakes seen during the film. Our protagonists seemed to analysing the malware with a hex editor. They seemed to be able to briefly look at hexadecimal code and immediate spot the flaw. However, this can be written off as Hollywood dramatic flair as no one wants to watch real time code debugging. Lastly, they depicted a 512 GPG being decrypted in 5 seconds with the NSA software. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Blackhat clearly was based on real world digital attacks showcasing the way in which major systems can be brought down by social engineering, USBs and phishing. The plot is by no means fantastical which is a refreshing take on the genre rather than the hacker magicians plaguing Hollywood. Although plot may drag the movie is grounded in technical reality which is endearing for those of us who love computer security.

        <h3 class="divide center">Movie Info</h3>

        <p class="center-text">After a Hong Kong nuclear plant and the Mercantile Trade Exchange in Chicago are hacked by unknown perpetrators, a federal agent (Viola Davis) proposes that the FBI work with China to find the cyber-criminals. The leader of the Chinese team, Chen Dawai, insists that convicted hacker Nick Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth) be released from prison to help with the investigation. As Nick and his comrades chase their quarry, it becomes evident that the hackers have a sinister motive for their actions.</p>
