        <h3 class="divide center">Our Review</h3>

        <p class="center-text">&emsp;&emsp;Hackers (1995) was an important movie from my youth that helped me define hacking, computer science, and cybersecurity. Its special effects, accurate portrayal of hacking and cybersecurity concerns in the ’90s, star-studded cast, and anti-capitalist storyline made it an iconic (almost cult) classic that computer-enthusiast audiences still enjoy today. While it may be riddled with what we would consider today to be outdated computers and technology, the ethical concepts the movie portrays are still prominent issues 25 years after its release.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The movie begins with a flashback of the lead protagonist, Dade Murphy, being arrested and convicted for releasing a virus that caused a stock market crash in 1988. Dade was indicted and forbidden to use a computer until his 18th birthday, and his family was fined a large sum of money. This incident is related to a real-world event known as the Morris Worm. In 1988, Robert Morris, a graduate student at Cornell University, was curious to determine the size of the internet and created software that would self-replicate to connected computers. A bug caused the worm to replicate faster than intended and prevented computers on numerous universities and research institutes from communicating information on their servers, slowing vital military and university functions (Shakelford 2018). The worm infected the University of California, Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, NASA, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, causing damages estimated to be at least $100,000 (FBI 2018). This is an excellent example of how the movie draws from real-world examples of cybersecurity concerns from the ‘90s and shows the ethical battles in computer hacking. Both Dade and Morris were curious. That curiosity is what drove many computer enthusiasts to test the limits of computing. Some used these skills to benefit others or society, while some used them for their personal gain. These two types of hacking are referred to as white hat hacking (ethical hacking) and black hat hacking (malicious hacking), respectively (Willis College 2021).
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;In Hackers, the characters Razor and Blade demonstrate a perfect example of white hat hacking when they show how to hack a payphone, a real-world exploit. They found a method to hack an unjust system and sought to distribute this knowledge to others. They justify their actions by stating, “Why pay for service that would be dirt-cheap if it weren’t run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons.” This anti-capitalist sentiment defines the type of ethical hacking that these two characters represent. They view capitalism as an unjust system and are portrayed positively in the movie as the protagonists idolize them. In the real world today, we see white hat hacking in online forums such as ‘thehackerforum.com.’ These are places where people can learn and share about cybersecurity while also promoting the ethical use of such skills.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;In contrast to ethical hackers, some people hack as a way to gain personal profit. The villain of the movie, The Plague, first plants a ransomware virus and frames the protagonists as the culprits and as terrorists. The Plagues’ real intention for planting the virus was to cover up a worm that he wrote to steal millions of dollars. Here we see two counts of black hat hacking, both against the company that employs The Plague as the head of cybersecurity. These types of attacks formed part of the reasoning for why the CFAA was passed. However, we see our protagonists don their white hats as they attempt to thwart the villain by analyzing the hex-code of the worm in a primarily realistic manner (surprisingly with small amounts of Hollywood embellishments). We see them attempting to read and understand the hex-code for several hours of in-movie time, which is the actual process of finding malware and decoding it to find ways to fix it.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;In this dichotomy of black and white hat hacking, the movie also portrays another category of people, the ignorant. Ignorant people are portrayed as knowing little about computers and even less about cybersecurity. Their ignorance makes them vulnerable to manipulation. The Plague refers to this group as “cattle”' as this is the group that he feeds off. This representation of unethical hacking and vulnerable ignorance is where the movie gains a great deal of its authenticity. The most significant threat to this group — the ignorant — (in real life and in the movie) is social engineering attacks. In the scenes where we see hackers hacking into the Gibson (the company’s server), they are not using the backdoors that they hypothesized earlier in the movie. Instead, they use the login credentials of employees that they were able to steal, spy, or even guess. One example of this type of exploitation is from the scene where Dade calls the TV station, pretending to be an employee, and manipulates the ignorant security guard into giving him the information needed to log in remotely to the station’s systems. These types of attacks go after the weakest link in cybersecurity; people. Despite 25 years of security improvement, this is still a prominent issue today. We still see social engineering attacks where people receive calls and are conned into giving up their personal information, leading to identity theft. Another current, real-world example includes organizations that pretend to be tech support and ‘offer to help’ and remote into their victim’s computer only to end up installing ransomware (Vaas 2016).
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Hackers offers a balanced approach to representing issues in cybersecurity accurately while maintaining an exciting plotline. We hear the characters use accurate terms and methods of hacking throughout the movie. Most importantly, it accurately represents how social engineering is the most prominent and long-standing issue for cybersecurity. This makes Hackers a relevant movie for discussing real-world cybersecurity problems and the ethical issues relating to white hat and black hat hackers.
