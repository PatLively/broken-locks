        <h3 class="divide center">Our Review</h3>

        <p class="center-text">&emsp;&emsp;This AMC drama is about the revolution of the personal computer and how online gaming led to the social internet and a global online community, as well as the commercialization of the world wide web. Generally, this show is about the world of computer science and programming and I am certain anyone with even a slight interest in computer science would love it. In this review I will be focusing on episode 2 in Season 2 specifically, as this episode mainly focuses on a lot of hacking and information security and privacy.
            <br><br>
        	In this episode, a hacker infiltrates Mutiny which is the gaming company of Cameron, the main protagonist of the show, and copies and alters the source code for one of their games called parallax. The hacker proceeds to give the source code away for free which is illegal, and is basically taking money out of their pockets. He then hacks the company again but this time re-writes the source code for another one of their games called Tank Battle, this time he actually optimized the code and their system which saved them money. He did this by adding code that allowed multiple users to play on the same phone line, and this was all achieved because some of Mutiny’s employees had backdoors in their code which the hacker eventually found and exploited. The general optimization of the code was of course of benefit to Cameron and her company but, like every other computer programmer out there, she could not warm up to the idea of someone infiltrating her systems and changing her code, even though said changes were good.
            It turned out that Tom was not actually just randomly hacking their systems, in actuality he loved what they did and all the games they created and therefore wanted to somehow be a part of it all, and hacking their systems was the best method he could think of. Cameron eventually offers him a job and a share in the company, and he accepts it and leaves his current job.
            <br><br>
        	Now focusing on the hacking and cybersecurity aspect, the general idea of Tom’s hacking method seems factually accurate and true, because the movie was based in the late 90’s and at that time in the show, most online security and encryption methods and features which we use today had not yet been implemented, such as the advanced encryption standard (AES) and anti-virus. By building his own PBX (Private Branch Exchange), he was able to let multiple users share a single phone line and play Mutiny games. Also, Mutiny was still a very young start-up company at the time, and a lot of their programmers in almost all departments were fresh, young graduates so they had virtually no experience which played a factor in why they got hacked the way they did.
            <br><br>
        	Mutiny should have taken a lot more steps to ensure that the privacy and security of their systems would not get compromised. However, they failed to implement any meaningful privacy and security features in their systems to protect the integrity of their code which contributed to their eventual hacking.
            One feature which could have protected them would have been implementing some public key (asymmetric) encryption or by using a one-time pad encryption (OTP) scheme which tends to be more secure. Although these methods compared to the modern advanced encryption standard (AES) do not seem as secure in modern times, back then they would have performed quite well against Tom’s attacks. Also, Mutiny should have invested in hiring more experienced and seasoned programmers, as that would ensure that no costly mistakes would be made, such as leaving backdoors in the code which could be potentially exploited and infiltrated by hackers.
