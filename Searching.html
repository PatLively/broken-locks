        <h3 class="divide center">Our Review</h3>

        <p class="center-text">&emsp;&emsp;<i>Searching</i> was filmed in an unconventional way - instead of a standard camera setup, the entire film was presented inside digital devices. All interactions that David had with other characters were shown inside a computer, smart phone, or home security devices, for example. David communicates with Margot via texting and Facetime, or verifies the reputation of detective Vicks by watching a YouTube video.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Prior to watching the film, I expected <i>Searching</i> to be restrictive and cheesy - restrictive because it wouldn’t give the actors enough screen time to build character, and cheesy in the sense that the “technology” portion of the film would be abused or used in unrealistic ways to the director’s advantage (I’ve seen too many horror shorts of people live streaming and pointing a camera at themselves through even the most ludicrous situations).
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;However, this film surprised me in a positive way. First, the fact that the audience was trapped inside a digital device was communicated creatively. Instead of being restrictive, the contents of these screens were a good exposition and showed us a lot about the characters. From the way David hid files relating to his late wife, to the unread emails that Pamela received from her cancer support group showed his reluctance to confront the grief of Pamela’s passing and the time that had elapsed since she passed.

            From the way David hid files relating to his late wife, to the unread emails that in Pamela's inbox from her cancer support group showed his reluctance to confront the grief of Pamela’s passing and the time that had elapsed since she passed.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;As for the character build up, John Cho’s performance was very moving, and though some scenes only showed his voice, while others were audioless footage, he expressed his character wonderfully, and it was easy as a viewer to sympathize with David’s frustrations and misery. While there were some plot holes in the film, the story was not what I expected and exceeded my expectations.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;In general, you’ll be pleasantly surprised if you watch this film not for the information security aspect, but for the creative way it’s filmed and the emotional twists and turns.
            <br><br>
            <b>How accurate was <i>Searching</i>?</b>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;The accuracy of the tech usage was accurate. Initially, we are hit with a blast of nostalgia as we’re shown Margot’s childhood through the computer - old versions of Windows OS, Flash games and early 2000’s eBay lights up the screen. In the present time, modern iPhones and Mac computers are used as the film’s platform. The apps and features used by David were generally real, with features that currently exist.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;In terms of the security aspect, <i>Searching</i>i> portrayed it quite accurately. When David realizes his key to finding Margot is through her social media accounts, he discovers that her accounts were set to private. Since Margot left her laptop at home and it was not password locked, David was able to access it (which was the most unbelievable part, in my opinion). Margot was logged out of all her accounts, none of which David knew the password to. Through a sequence of the “forgot my password” options, David accessed Margot’s Gmail because his late wife’s email was the two factor verification email for Margot’s account. Through Pamela’s email account, David was able to verify himself as Margot and change her password for her email, which he then used to verify and access her Facebook account, allowing him to make strides in his investigation.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;David was no l33t hacker, he was simply a dad who knew the password to one account, which he was able to leverage to gain access to all of Margot’s email, social media and even bank account. This situation happened to work positively in David’s favour, but it shows that someone only needs to access one account to unlock the door to all other accounts.
            <br><br>
            <b>How secure is two-factor authentication?</b>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;According to a study conducted by New York University and the University of California, San Diego in collaboration with Google, two-factor authentication (2FA) via SMS to a recovery phone number blocked 100% of automated bots, 96% of bulk phishing attacks and 76% of targeted attacks. Without a recovery phone, Google uses knowledge-based questions, which is effective against bots, but 10% less protected against phishing and targeted attacks. While using a recovery phone is more secure, Google does not enforce it as a requirement because users would be more at risk of being locked out of their own accounts; 38% of their participants did not have their phone on hand and 34% could not recall their secondary email address.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;While Google’s automated protections were able to block out most bots and phishing attacks, they reported that attackers rely on phishing emails that impersonate family, friends, and government officials. Some may even send follow-up attacks for up to a month and it’s estimated that one million Google users face the risk of a targeted attack.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Using email as 2FA has the advantage of being familiar to users (users are used to giving their email address for updates), easy to use (it does not require an additional device or app) and users do not have to give out additional information (such as a phone number).
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;However, like we witnessed in Searching, passwords can easily be reset via email. If an attacker is able to compromise a user’s email, they can take over several accounts. To prevent this from happening, Google recommends doing regular security checkups and adding a recovery phone number.

        <h3 class="divide center">Movie Info</h3>

        <p class="center-text">In <i>Searching</i>, John Cho plays David Kim, a loving father to teenage daughter Margot (Michelle La) and devoted husband to Pamela (Sara Sohn), who passed away from lymphoma shortly before Margot enters high school. After a late night study session with her friends, Margot disappears and David contacts the police. He is reassured by award-winning detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing), who is assigned to help him find Margot. Under the guidance of Vick, David attempts to find Margot’s last whereabouts by retracing her online activities. To do so, David accesses Margot’s computer and social media accounts, where he discovers that he may not have known his daughter as well as he thought. Racing against time, David tracks down Margot’s contacts and exhausts his options to find his daughter, making some surprising discoveries along the way.</p>
