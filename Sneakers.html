        <h3 class="divide center">Our Review</h3>

        <p class="center-text">&emsp;&emsp;When it released in 1992 the movie Sneakers was a commercial success, grossing over 100 million worldwide in the box office. However, I would like to explore just how well the movie portrayed the technology and cryptology concepts that the plot revolves around. The movie begins with college friends Cosmo (Ben Kingsley) and Martin Brice aka Marty (Robert Redford) having access to the US Federal Reserve Banking Network. They use this access to donate funds from the Republican party to charities in an effort to “change the world”. Unfortunately, the movie never reveals any means by which these two college students would be able to access such a sensitive network. While I cannot definitively argue that it would be impossible for them to gain such access it does seem unlikely. Given that there was no public cryptology standard at the time and that this was at the height of the cold war, I for one doubt these two college students had more computing power and intelligence than all of the Soviet Union. Not to mention most encryption standards at the time were classified.

            <br><br>Skip ahead to present day San Francisco and Marty has become a professional sneaker. This means he along with his team of misfit techies and ex-CIA operative Donald Crease (Sidney Poitier) sneak into companies to highlight their security flaws. This was not a common practice in the early 90’s but is now a multimillion-dollar industry so the movie did a good job of highlighting some of the ways computer security can be developed. Eventually, Martin’s college stunt with Cosmo catches up with him and he’s forced to steal a “black box” from mathematician and cryptography expert Dr. Gunter Janek. This expert gives a lecture during one scene explaining how in theory someone could come up with a shortcut for factoring very large numbers and thus make decrypting any encryption computationally feasible. Well, it turns out Dr. Janek has done just that and encoded this solution into the “black box” Marty is tasked with stealing. Marty and his team demonstrate the box’s capability by hacking into all kinds of sensitive national systems like the national power grid, and the US treasury (presumably they have updated their security since Marty’s college days).
            
            <br><br>So, is such a break-all decryption tool possible or just a figment of imagination? The answer is not so simple as it turns out, and to answer it we need to briefly look at two of the most common encryption standards available at the time. First up is RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), an asymmetric cryptography algorithm based on the fact that finding the factors of a number that is the product of two large primes is very difficult. Asymmetric algorithm means that the keys for encryption and decryption are different. Now if you’re keen you might have realized RSA does sound like something Dr. Janek’s box would be very good at breaking. The second standard at the time was DES (Data Encryption Standard), a symmetric key algorithm that uses complicated functions to transform a plaintext into a ciphertext of the same bit length. Symmetric just means that decryption is just the reverse of the encryption steps. DES was the standard chosen by the US government at the time for all unclassified communications. However, it is unlikely that the NSA used DES encryption for their classified information, rather it was likely a complicated system involving something that was a combination of both encryption systems.
            
            <br><br>After looking into it I found out that the writers of the movie consulted Dr. Leonard Adleman, one of the creators of RSA, work which landed him the Turing Award in 2002. In particular, while Dr. Janek’s lecture in the movie is filled with jargon and large words unintelligible even to some experts in the area it is actually accurate and based on real science. However, the concept it discusses would only really be able to help with the prime factorization problem which RSA is based on. Therefore, Dr. Janek’s black box would not be able to break any and all encryptions, rather, he would only be able to break all the RSA encryptions at the time. The movie does address this in passing saying the box was designed to break “American” codes. It is worth noting though that it is unlikely this would have worked for the government networks the movie showed being hacked. So, while the movie might have used accurate language thanks to the writers employing the aid of Dr. Adleman, it seems like this break all black box might be a bit in the realm of science fiction. 
            
            <br><br>Overall, I think the movie did a good job of staying true to the spirit of cryptography and hacking, despite the missing info in the opening scene. Particularly I think the movie does a very good job in demonstrating the role of social engineering when it comes to exposing glaring weaknesses in security systems. Showing that sometimes, even with the most advanced security systems, the users themselves are the weakest link. This is a good movie that cryptography enthusiasts would enjoy.
