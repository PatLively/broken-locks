        <h3 class="divide center">Our Review</h3>

        <p class="center-text">&emsp;&emsp;From the get-go, Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a stellar job playing the role of Edward Snowden - there were scenes where his voice and speech patterns were comparable to the real Snowden. The other characters performed wonderfully, especially Rhys Ifans, who portrayed the CIA’s deputy director with the right dose of creepy. What I did not enjoy was how much of the “whiz kid” persona the film presented Snowden as. He was able to solve tests with impeccable speed and was recognized (and praised) by directors way above his status. When a character’s skills and reputations are at such an uncanny level, they become hard to empathize with.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;At the same time, for someone so skilled, he made dumb mistakes. For example, in a climatic scene, Snowden sneaks a microSD card into the facility and copies over confidential data, which was later used as evidence for Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill’s article in <i>The Guardian</i>. The menus pop up to indicate files being downloaded and Snowden decides to… look around suspiciously  instead of opening a work window to hide the transfer? Rookie mistake for an ex-CIA staff.
            <br><br>
            <b>But how accurate was <i>Snowden</i>?</b>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Being based on the life of the real Edward Snowden, some parts were based on the truth. However, in order to produce a box-office worthy storyline, many events were exaggerated and in some cases, false. For example, during his time working for the NSA in Tokyo, the Snowden in the film created EpicShelter, a program used to back up data in the event that the physical server was destroyed. He later was horrified to learn that his program was repurposed to gather data aiding in drone strikes on targets in Pakistan.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;This was debated by a Slate article; they argued that Snowden likely had no involvement in the development of an important program such as EpicShelter since he was hired as a Systems Administrator.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;However, it is now well-known that the NSA was indeed involved in mass domestic surveillance. Throughout 2007 to 2013, the NSA established a secret program called Prism that allowed the agency to seize data from the servers of Google, Facebook, Apple and large telecommunications/internet companies without their consent. As reported by the real Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill, the NSA received all aspects of communications, including emails, photos, videos, social networking details, and voice/video chat. The NSA did not necessarily keep the data of people who were not of interest, but they kept the metadata. So while <i>Snowden</i> exaggerated some of the information that NSA officials had access to, it was accurate that the agency could store a person’s basic information and data related to their social network.
            <br><br>
            <b>How was the NSA able to obtain this information?</b>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit digital rights group, after 9/11, the government enlisted the help of major U.S. telecommunications companies by having them secretly install surveillance equipment in their facilities.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;In one documented instance, AT&T installed fiber-optic splitters in their San Francisco facility; as clients’ internet traffic traveled through AT&T’s network, the data sent was diverted to the fiber-optic cable, which is connected to a secret room controlled by the NSA. The splitters make copies of the data, where one stream of data is sent to its recipient, and the other stream to the NSA, where they would be able to analyze and store the data. These splitters were installed in multiple telecommunication junction points throughout the United States.
            <br><br>
            <b>XKEYSCORE</b>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;A system that was highlighted in <i>Snowden</i>, XKeyscore, did exist and was reported to serve a similar purpose as the film. Edward Snowden claimed that the system gave the agency access to individuals’ online activities, and was a way for the NSA to bypass the need to obtain warrants. In a press statement from the NSA, the agency claims that XKeyscore was “a part of NSA’s lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system” and allegations that they abused the system was untrue. They also claimed that over 300 terrorists were captured using intelligence from XKeyscore. Aside from screenshots published by <i>The Guardian</i> and a removed job posting by a defence contractor looking for an XKeyscore Systems Engineer, there is not much evidence to say for sure.
            <br><br>
            <b>Dual_EC_DRBG, the NSA's "backdoor"</b>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Although not mentioned in <i>Snowden</i>, a method the NSA uses to access private information, which is related to the content of this course, is by using a “backdoor” to a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). In 2007, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency that publishes technology standards for public and private sector use, contains 3 standard PRNG. One of them is an algorithm named Dual_EC_DRBG (Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator), which generates random numbers based on dual elliptic curves. Being a NIST standard meant that Dual_EC_DRBG would be trusted and used in many cryptographic systems.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;In the same year, at a crypto conference presentation, two Microsoft crypto experts presented a weakness in Dual_EC_DRBG; the algorithm generated numbers with a bias to a secret set of numbers, and believed that the algorithm was created with an (intended) backdoor. They showed that anyone who had the secret set of numbers would be able to predict Dual_EC_DRBG’s output and break the encryption. That’s right, a secret key that… the NIST or NSA may have access to. For reasons unknown, this presentation was not given the attention it deserved until after the Snowden leaks.
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;Afterwards, it was also found that the NSA made a $10 million contract to use Dual_EC_DRBG in one of their cryptographic libraries. The RSA later told developers to not use the Dual EC_DRBG algorithm, which was the default, but it was probably too late. These institutions, trusted by both the public and private sector, had tarnished their reputation by sneaking in an NSA backdoor as their standards.
            <br><br>
            So while <i>Snowden</i> was not completely accurate in its depiction, it was accurate in showing that the NSA had access to <i>a lot</i> of private data. If you were to see this film (and I recommend that you see it), be prepared for a wave of paranoia for your privacy that you may experience afterwards.

        <h3 class="divide center">Movie Info</h3>

        <p class="center-text"><i>Snowden</i> is a 2016 film about Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a patriot and former U.S. computer intelligence expert turned whistleblower. The movie follows Snowden’s life from 2004 to 2013, where he rose up as a CIA trainee to an intelligence expert for the CIA and the NSA. As his career progresses, he becomes disillusioned after becoming aware of the extent of mass surveillance and unethical acts encouraged by his superiors and associates, justified in the name of national security.</p>
