        <h3 class="divide center">Our Review</h3>

        <p class="center-text">&emsp;&emsp;Swordfish is yet another computer hacking movie classic, mainly for its action-packed sequences and hacker protagonist. Audiences loved the portrayal of a white hat hacker who is just trying to go straight to get his kid back, and being played by Hugh Jackman (popularized in part by his role as Wolverine in X-Men) also added to the character’s appeal. The movie was chock-full of Hollywood big names, including John Travolta, Halle Berry, and Don Cheadle. This star-studded cast meant that audiences mostly wanted to see Swordfish for its big-name actors.  Unfortunately, the movie also presented audiences with a wildly inaccurate portrayal of cybersecurity and hacking. Swordfish’s script included some accurate terms and concepts, but its presentation of cybersecurity is heavily padded with Hollywood pizzazz in an attempt to further the plot and build characters.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The first scene of Hollywood embellishment occurs when Stan needs to hack into the U.S. Department of Defence. Here we see a laptop showing the DOD’s login screen with a DES 128-bit encryption. DES (Data Encryption Standard) was an encryption standard used by governments (including the US). Still, it was deemed insecure due to its vulnerability to brute-force attacks (just going through each key). DES was declared a standard for unclassified information due to this vulnerability. What made it so weak was that it used a 64-bit key that had the strength of a 56-bit key. What the movie is showing is likely a Triple-DES (3DES) encryption which actually could use a 128-bit key (Zande 2001). DES had been superseded by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), which has proved to be more secure against brute-force attacks. The code we see Stan writing does just that, but there are a couple of flaws. First, the code shown is not accurate as we see IP address segments that are greater than 255. Second, while Stan set up the program within 60 seconds, the program’s time to run would take hours or, most likely, days. Granted, watching a program run for that long wouldn’t make for good cinema.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The next big issue lies with the worm that Stan needs to create. He is told that the network’s encryption, where the worm will be released, uses a 512-bit Vernam encryption. The Vernam cipher uses the one-time pad method where extra random data is added so that identical messages do not generate the same ciphertext (encryption output). The problem with the movie’s representation of the Vernam cipher mostly lies with the 512-bit encryption. Each of the pieces of information that the worm would have to sort through would take a relatively long time to decipher. Yet somehow, the code in the movie seems to run relatively instantly. When Stan is creating the worm, we are shown a 3D geometric representation of it. In a real-world setting, he would be working directly with code, not a 3D graphic. However, this wouldn’t be as visually pleasing to the audience, especially when watching his code fail to compile.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;Despite these inaccuracies, we do see an accurate and effective hacking method in the movie. To get the worm onto the network, they need to access it locally. Gabriel threatens the bank employee to get the servers’ physical key to gain access to the network. This intimidation tactic effectively demonstrates how the weakest link in a security system is people. It’s just like the xkcd (xkcd #538) comic where a ‘crypto-nerd’ is faced with a strong encryption and suggests just using a $5 wrench to obtain the password. Granted, I’m pretty sure the movie’s portrayal of attacking the bank with assault weapons and an armored bus cost more than $5. If the bank’s network was connected to an external network, the same outcomes could have been achieved remotely without physically storming into the bank. An external network-based attack would have cost less and risked fewer lives, but it also would have made for a boring action movie.
<br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;The writers appear to have consulted with cybersecurity specialists when writing the script for Swordfish because we see the characters using accurate computing and network security terminology. However, the primary inaccuracies in the movie result from problems in the followthrough. The portrayal of hacking and cybersecurity is grossly exaggerated to advance the plot and create excuses for action scenes. John Travolta’s character in Swordfish put it best when he says, “Realism. Not a pervasive element in modern American cinematic vision.”
