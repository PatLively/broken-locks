        <h3 class="divide center">Our Review</h3>

        <p class="center-text">&emsp;&emsp;Who Am I (2014) is a great movie filled with plot twists and good acting revolving around an up and coming hacker group in Germany. This review will attempt to focus on the hacking aspects of the film but in order to do so, some synopsis of the plot is required. So be forewarned some spoilers ahead. The story follows Benjamin Engel (Tom Schilling), a societal outcast obsessed with computers whose role model is an underground hacker by the name MRX. He also happens to be the unreliable narrator of the film. It all begins with Benjamin turning himself in to authorities as the most wanted hacker ‘Who Am I’. He lets the authorities know that he will only speak to Hanne Lindberg (Trine Dyrholm) the head of the Cyber Division of Europol. Benjamin begins his confession to Lindberg with the time he ran into his childhood crush Marie (Hannah Herzsprung) while delivering pizzas at his job. During the interaction he is inspired to be her “super hero” and he decides to hack into university servers to steal and give her the answers to the law exam. This is where we get to our first scene involving hacking. Benjamin enters the university and gains access to the server room where he finds the answers to the exam and copies them to his computer. The movie fails to show any real technical know-how in this scene, with the answers just being in a conveniently named folder and the servers seemingly having no encryption what so ever. 

        <br><br>Unfortunately for Benjamin though, what the servers did have was a security guard checking in on them and Benjamin is caught and arrested. He is sentenced to 50 hours of community service, during which he meets fellow hacker Max (Elias M’Barek). Here they discuss how Benjamin was able to get past the access control of the university servers. The movie shows us that it may have the technical know-how after all, with the two characters discussing the attack using prominent hacking language. They shortly discuss things like DDOS attacks, script kiddies, server access control points, machine code, and zero-day exploits. The latter being how Benjamin supposedly accessed the university server.
            
        <br><br>Having become friends, benjamin joins max and his friends Stephan (Wotan Wilke Möhring) and Paul (Antoine Monot Jr.), to create the hacker group CLAY (Clowns Laughing at You). This is when we really get to see the movie push its hacking knowledge to the maximum. Firstly, the movie shows that it knows hacking is not just one person sitting behind a computer and writing code, especially when it comes to hacking more advanced systems. Max was the social engineering expert, Paul was the hardware expert, Stephan was the software expert, and Benjamin was the machine code expert. I appreciated that the movie highlighted the users being a major weakness in security systems, at one point showing an excellent example of a phishing attack. It also did a good job highlighting that you usually need a team with varying expertise to crack the extra secure systems. Secondly, the movie seems to show a good grasp on command shell commands and their format. At one point, the command shell also shows that the group is running an Nmap scan to detect vulnerabilities in a system. They earned points from me on that one because they utilized a concept not known to the general public. Also, because the command only flashes across screen for a second but they still took the time to make it accurate. Lastly, in the second half of the movie when the characters Benjamin and MRX are trying to find each other the movie again shows a good grasp on hacking vocabulary. The characters throw around words like trojans and IP trackers and while they keep it simple, they do manage to use the language correctly. That being said the movie does get lazy at times and relies on tropes, for example in the scene where Benjamin has to prove his skills to Max, Paul, and Stephan. Benjamin essentially jumps on a random home computer, types a terminal command and the screen flashes with a bunch of windows seemingly filled with gibberish and then the whole neighborhood power grid shuts down. 
            
        <br><br>Overall, Who Am I (2014) is a solid movie that does a good job of balancing the act of making hacking accessible to the general public while also not committing too many mistakes that might break immersion for some of their more knowledgeable viewers. If you are expecting a movie with flawless depiction of hacking you will surely be disappointed but if you are a hacking afficionado who also happens to enjoy suspenseful thriller movies I’d recommend you give this movie a watch.
